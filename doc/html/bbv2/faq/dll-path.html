    </h2></div></div></div>
<p>(This entry is specific to Unix system.)Before answering the
      questions, let's recall a few points about shared libraries. Shared
      libraries can be used by several applications, or other libraries,
      without phisycally including the library in the application. This can
      greatly decrease the total size of applications. It's also possible to
      upgrade a shared library when the application is already
      installed. Finally, shared linking can be faster.
    </p>
<p>However, the shared library must be found when the application is
      started. The dynamic linker will search in a system-defined list of
      paths, load the library and resolve the symbols. Which means that you
      should either change the system-defined list, given by the
      <code class="envar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable, or install the
      libraries to a system location. This can be inconvenient when
      developing, since the libraries are not yet ready to be installed, and
      cluttering system paths is undesirable. Luckily, on Unix there's another
      way.
    </p>
<p>An executable can include a list of additional library paths, which
      will be searched before system paths. This is excellent for development,
      because the build system knows the paths to all libraries and can include
      them in executables. That's done when the <code class="computeroutput">hardcode-dll-paths</code>
      feature has the <code class="literal">true</code> value, which is the
      default. When the executables should be installed, the story is
      different.
    </p>
<p>
      Obviously, installed executable should not hardcode paths to your
      development tree. (The <code class="computeroutput">stage</code> rule explicitly disables the
      <code class="computeroutput">hardcode-dll-paths</code> feature for that reason.) However, you
      can use the <code class="computeroutput">dll-path</code> feature to add explicit paths
      manually. For example:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
stage installed : application : &lt;dll-path&gt;/usr/lib/snake
                                &lt;location&gt;/usr/bin ;          
</pre>
<p>
      will allow the application to find libraries placed to
      <code class="filename">/usr/lib/snake</code>.
    </p>
<p>If you install libraries to a nonstandard location and add an
      explicit path, you get more control over libraries which will be used. A
      library of the same name in a system location will not be inadvertently
      used.  If you install libraries to a system location and do not add any
      paths, the system administrator will have more control. Each library can
      be individually upgraded, and all applications will use the new library.
    </p>
<p>Which approach is best depends on your situation. If the libraries
      are relatively standalone and can be used by third party applications,
      they should be installed in the system location. If you have lots of
      libraries which can be used only by your application, it makes sense to
      install it to a nonstandard directory and add an explicit path, like the
      example above shows. Please also note that guidelines for different
      systems differ in this respect. The Debian guidelines prohibit any
      additional search paths, and Solaris guidelines suggest that they should
      always be used.
