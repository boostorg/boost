<h3 class="title">Warning</h3>
<p>The information is this section is likely to be outdated
        and misleading. 
      </p>
</div>
<p>To construct a main target with given properties from sources,
      it is required to create a dependency graph for that main target,
      which will also include actions to be run. The algorithm for
      creating the dependency graph is described here.</p>
<p>The fundamental concept is <span class="emphasis"><em>generator</em></span>. If encapsulates
      the notion of build tool and is capable to converting a set of
      input targets into a set of output targets, with some properties.
      Generator matches a build tool as closely as possible: it works
      only when the tool can work with requested properties (for
      example, msvc compiler can't work when requested toolset is gcc),
      and should produce exactly the same targets as the tool (for
      example, if Borland's linker produces additional files with debug
      information, generator should also).</p>
<p>Given a set of generators, the fundamental operation is to
      construct a target of a given type, with given properties, from a
      set of targets. That operation is performed by rule
      <code class="literal">generators.construct</code> and the used algorithm is described
      below.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id1702485"></a>Selecting and ranking viable generators</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Each generator, in addition to target types that it can
        produce, have attribute that affects its applicability in
        particular sitiation. Those attributes are:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
            Required properties, which are properties absolutely
            necessary for the generator to work. For example, generator
            encapsulating the gcc compiler would have &lt;toolset&gt;gcc as
            required property.
          </li>
<li>
            Optional properties, which increase the generators
            suitability for a particual build.
          </li>
</ol></div>
<p>
        Generator's required and optional properties may not include
        either free or incidental properties. (Allowing this would
        greatly complicate caching targets).
      </p>
<p>When trying to construct a target, the first step is to select
        all possible generators for the requested target type, which
        required properties are a subset of requested properties.
        Generators that were already selected up the call stack are
        excluded. In addition, if any composing generators were selected
        up the call stack, all other composing generators are ignored
        (TODO: define composing generators). The found generators
        are assigned a rank, which is the number of optional properties
        present in requested properties. Finally, generators with highest
        rank are selected for futher processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id1702526"></a>Running generators</h3></div></div></div>
<p>When generators are selected, each is run to produce a list of
        created targets. This list might include targets that are not of
        requested types, because generators create the same targets as
        some tool, and tool's behaviour is fixed. (Note: should specify
        that in some cases we actually want extra targets). If generator
        fails, it returns an empty list. Generator is free to call
        'construct' again, to convert sources to the types it can handle.
        It also can pass modified properties to 'construct'. However, a
        generator is not allowed to modify any propagated properties,
        otherwise when actually consuming properties we might discover
        that the set of propagated properties is different from what was
        used for building sources.</p>
<p>For all targets that are not of requested types, we try to
        convert them to requested type, using a second call to
        <code class="literal">construct</code>. This is done in order to support
        transformation sequences where single source file expands to
        several later. See <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jamboost/message/1667" target="_top">this
          message</a> for details.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id1702551"></a>Selecting dependency graph</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
        After all generators are run,
        it is necessary to decide which of successfull invocation will be
        taken as final result. At the moment, this is not done. Instead,
        it is checked whether all successfull generator invocation
        returned the same target list. Error is issued otherwise.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id1702563"></a>Property adjustment</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Because target location is determined by the build system, it
        is sometimes necessary to adjust properties, in order to not
        break actions. For example, if there's an action that generates
        a header, say "a_parser.h", and a source file "a.cpp" which
        includes that file, we must make everything work as if a_parser.h
        is generated in the same directory where it would be generated
        without any subvariants.</p>
<p>Correct property adjustment can be done only after all targets
        are created, so the approach taken is:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p>
            When dependency graph is constructed, each action can be
            assigned a rule for property adjustment.
          </p></li>
<li><p>
            When virtual target is actualized, that rule is run and
            return the final set of properties. At this stage it can use
            information of all created virtual targets.
          </p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>In case of quoted includes, no adjustment can give 100% correct
        results. If target dirs are not changed by build system, quoted
        includes are searched in "." and then in include path, while angle
        includes are searched only in include path. When target dirs are
        changed, we'd want to make quoted includes to be search in "." then in
        additional dirs and then in the include path and make angle includes
        be searched in include path, probably with additional paths added at
        some position. Unless, include path already has "." as the first
        element, this is not possible. So, either generated headers should not
        be included with quotes, or first element of include path should be
        ".", which essentially erases the difference between quoted and angle
        includes. <span class="bold"><strong>Note:</strong></span> the only way to get
        "." as include path into compiler command line is via verbatim
        compiler option. In all other case, Boost.Build will convert "." into
        directory where it occurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="id1702606"></a>Transformations cache</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
        Under certain conditions, an
        attempt is made to cache results of transformation search. First,
        the sources are replaced with targets with special name and the
        found target list is stored. Later, when properties, requested
        type, and source type are the same, the store target list is
        retrieved and cloned, with appropriate change in names.
