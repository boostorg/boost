      <h2 align="left"><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p align="left">This page describes requirements and guidelines for the content of 
         a library submitted to Boost.</p>
      <p align="left">See the <a href="submission_process.htm">Boost Library Submission 
            Process</a> page for a description of the process involved.</p>
      <h2 align="left"><a name="Requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
      <p>To avoid the frustration and wasted time of a proposed library being rejected, 
         it must meets these requirements:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            The license must meet the <a href="#License">license requirements</a>
         below. Restricted licenses like the GPL and LGPL are not acceptable.
         <li>
            The copyright <a href="#Ownership">ownership</a>
         must be clear.
         <li>
         The library must be generally useful and not restricted to a narrow problem 
         domain.
         <li>
            The library must meet the <a href="#Portability">portability requirements</a>
         below.&nbsp;
         <li>
            The library must come reasonably close to meeting the <a href="#Guidelines">Guidelines</a>
            below.
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <a href="#Design_and_Programming">Design and Programming</a>
               <li>
                  <a href="#Directory_structure">Directory Structure</a>
               <li>
                  <a href="#Documentation">Documentation</a></li>
            </ul>
         <li>
            The author must be willing to participate in discussions on the mailing list, 
            and to refine the library accordingly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There's no requirement that an author read the mailing list for a time before 
         making a submission. It has been noted, however, that submissions which begin 
         "I just started to read this mailing list ..." seem to fail, often 
         embarrassingly.</p>
      <h3 align="left"><a name="License">License</a> requirements</h3>
      <p>The preferred way to meet the license requirements is to use the <a href="../LICENSE_1_0.txt">
            Boost Software License</a>. See <a href="license_info.html">license information</a>. 
         If for any reason you do not intend to use the Boost Software License, please 
         discuss the issues on the Boost <a href="mailing_lists.htm#main">developers 
            mailing list</a> first.</p>
      <p>The license requirements:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
         Must be simple to read and understand.
         <li>
         Must grant permission without fee to copy, use and modify the software for any 
         use (commercial and non-commercial).
         <li>
         Must require that the license appear on all copies of the software source code.
         <li>
         Must not require that the license appear with executables or other binary uses 
         of the library.
         <li>
         Must not require that the source code be available for execution or other 
         binary uses of the library.
         <li>
            May restrict the use of the name and description of the library to the standard 
            version found on the Boost web site.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 align="left"><a name="Portability">Portability</a> requirements</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p align="left">A library's interface must portable and not restricted to a 
               particular compiler or operating system.</p>
         <li>
            <p align="left">A library's implementation must if possible be portable and not 
               restricted to a particular compiler or operating system.&nbsp; If a portable 
               implementation is not possible, non-portable constructions are acceptable if 
               reasonably easy to port to other environments, and implementations are provided 
               for at least two popular operating systems (such as UNIX and Windows).</p>
         <li>
            <p align="left">There is no requirement that a library run on C++ compilers which 
               do not conform to the ISO standard.&nbsp;</p>
         <li>
            <p align="left">There is no requirement that a library run on any particular C++ 
               compiler.&nbsp; Boost contributors often try to ensure their libraries work 
               with popular compilers.&nbsp; The boost/config.hpp <a href="../libs/config/config.htm">
                  configuration header</a> is the preferred mechanism for working around 
               compiler deficiencies.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">Since there is no absolute way to prove portability, many boost 
         submissions demonstrate practical portability by compiling and executing 
         correctly with two different C++ compilers, often under different operating 
         systems.&nbsp; Otherwise reviewers may disbelieve that porting is in fact 
         practical.</p>
      <h3 align="left"><a name="Ownership">Ownership</a></h3>
      <p align="left">Are you sure you own the library you are thinking of 
         submitting?&nbsp;&nbsp; "How to Copyright Software" by MJ Salone, Nolo Press, 
         1990 says:</p>
      <blockquote>
         <p align="left">Doing work on your own time that is very similar to programming 
            you do for your employer on company time can raise nasty legal problems.&nbsp; 
            In this situation, it's best to get a written release from your employer in 
            advance.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">Place a copyright notice in all the important files you submit. 
         Boost won't accept libraries without clear copyright information.</p>
      <h2 align="left"><a name="Guidelines">Guidelines</a></h2>
      <p align="left">Please use these guidelines as a checklist for preparing the 
         content a library submission.&nbsp; Not every guideline applies to every 
         library, but a reasonable effort to comply is expected.</p>
      <h3><a name="Design_and_Programming">Design and Programming</a></h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Aim first for clarity and correctness; optimization should be only a secondary 
            concern in most Boost libraries.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Aim for ISO Standard C++. Than means making effective use of the standard 
            features of the language, and avoiding non-standard compiler extensions. It 
            also means using the C++ Standard Library where applicable.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Headers should be good neighbors. See the <a href="header.htm">header policy</a>. 
            See <a href="#Naming&shy;_consistency">Naming consistency</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Follow quality programming practices. See, for example, "Effective C++" 2nd 
            Edition, and "More Effective C++", both by Scott Meyers, published by Addison 
            Wesley.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Use the C++ Standard Library or other Boost libraries, but only when the 
            benefits outweigh the costs.&nbsp; Do not use libraries other than the C++ 
            Standard Library or Boost. See <a href="library_reuse.htm">Library reuse</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Read <a href="imp_vars.htm">Implementation Variation</a> to see how to supply 
            performance, platform, or other implementation variations.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Read the <A href="separate_compilation.html">guidelines for libraries with 
               separate source</A>
         to see how to ensure that compiled link libraries meet user expectations.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <LI>
            Use the naming conventions of the C++ Standard Library (See <a href="#Naming">Naming 
               conventions rationale</a>):
            <br>
            &nbsp;<ul>
               <li>
               Names (except as noted below) should be all lowercase, with words separated by 
               underscores.
               <li>
                  Acronyms should be treated as ordinary names (e.g. <code>xml_parser</code> instead 
                  of <code>XML_parser</code>).
               <li>
               Template parameter names begin with an uppercase letter.
               <li>
                  Macro (gasp!) names all uppercase and begin with BOOST_.</li>
            </ul>
         </LI>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Choose meaningful names - explicit is better than implicit, and readability 
            counts. There is a strong preference for clear and descriptive names, even if 
            lengthy.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Use exceptions to report errors where appropriate, and write code that is safe 
            in the face of exceptions.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Avoid exception-specifications. See <a href="#Exception-specification">exception-specification 
               rationale</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Provide sample programs or confidence tests so potential users can see how to 
            use your library.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Provide a regression test program or programs which follow the <a href="test_policy.htm">
               Test Policies and Protocols</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Although some boost members use proportional fonts, tabs, and unrestricted line 
            lengths in their own code, boost's widely distributed source code should follow 
            more conservative guidelines:
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Use fixed-width fonts.&nbsp; See <a href="#code_fonts">fonts rationale</a>.
               <li>
                  Use spaces rather than tabs. See <a href="#Tabs">tabs rationale</a>.
               <li>
                  Limit line lengths to 80 characters.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            End all documentation files (HTML or otherwise) with a copyright message and a 
            licensing message. See the <a href="#Copyright">end of this file</a> for an 
            example of the preferred form.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Begin all source files (including programs, headers, scripts, etc.) with:
            <br>
            &nbsp;<ul>
               <li>
                  A comment line describing the contents of the file.<br>
               &nbsp;
               <li>

<p>Include a comment based on the following template, substituting
appropriate text for the italicized portion:

                  Please leave an empty line before and after the copyright and license comments. 
                  It is fine if the copyright and license messages are on different lines, but 
                  there should be no other intervening text. Do not include "All rights reserved"

                  <br>
                  Note that developers should not include a copy of <code>LICENSE_1_0.txt</code> in 
                  their libraries; Boost distributions already include a copy in the Boost root 
                  directory.<br>
               &nbsp;
               <li>
                  A comment line referencing your library on the Boost web site. For example:<br>
                  <br>
                  <code>//&nbsp; See http://www.boost.org/libs/foo for library home page.</code><br>
                  <br>
                  where <code>foo</code> is the directory name (see below) for your library. As 
                  well as aiding users who come across a Boost file detached from its 
                  documentation, some of Boost's automatic tools depend on this comment to 
                  identify which library header files belong to.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Make sure your code compiles in the presence of the <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code>
            macros. Some platform headers define <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> macros which
            cause some common C++ constructs to fail to compile. Some simple tricks can protect your code
            from inappropriate macro substitution:<br>&nbsp;
            <ul>
               <li>
                  If you want to call <code>std::min()</code> or <code>std::max()</code>:<br>&nbsp;
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        If you do not require argument-dependent look-up, use <code>(std::min)(a,b)</code>.
                     </li>&nbsp;
                     <li>
                        If you do require argument-dependent look-up, you should:<br>&nbsp;
                        <ul>
                           <li><code>#include &lt;boost/config.hpp&gt;</code></li>&nbsp;
                           <li>Use <code>BOOST_USING_STD_MIN();</code> to bring <code>std::min()</code> into
                               the current scope.</li>&nbsp;
                           <li>Use <code>min BOOST_PREVENT_MACRO_SUBSTITUTION (a,b);</code> to make an
                               argument-dependent call to <code>min(a,b)</code>.</li>&nbsp;
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                  </ul>&nbsp;
               </li>
               <li>
                  If you want to call <code>std::numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max()</code>, use
                  <code>(std::numeric_limits&lt;int&gt;::max)()</code> instead.<br>&nbsp;
               </li>
               <li>
                  If you want to call a <code>min()</code> or <code>max()</code> member function,
                  instead to doing <code>obj.min()</code>, use <code>(obj.min)()</code>.<br>&nbsp;
               </li>
               <li>
                  If you want to declare or define a function or a member function named <code>min</code>
                  or <code>max</code>, then you must use the <code>BOOST_PREVENT_MACRO_SUBSTITUTION</code>
                  macro. Instead of writing <code>int min() { return 0; }</code> you should write
                  <code>int min BOOST_PREVENT_MACRO_SUBSTITUTION () { return 0; }</code> This is true
                  regardless if the function is a free (namespace scope) function, a member function or a
                  static member function, and it applies for the function declaration as well as the
                  function definition.<br>&nbsp;
               </li>
            </ul>

      <h3><a name="Directory_structure">Directory Structure</a> and Filenames</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
         File and directory names must contain only <b>lowercase</b> ASCII letters , numbers, 
         underscores, and a period.&nbsp; Leading character must be alphabetic. Maximum 
         length 31. Only a single period is permitted.&nbsp; These requirements ensure 
         file and directory names are relatively portable.
         <li>
            Files intended to be processed by a C++ compiler as part
            of a translation unit should have <b>a three-letter
            extension ending in &quot;pp&quot;</b>.  Other files should
            <i>not</i> use extensions ending in &quot;pp&quot;.  This
            convention makes it easy to identify all of the C++ source
            in Boost.</li>
         <li>
            All libraries have at their highest level a primary directory named for the 
            particular library. See <a href="#Naming&shy;_consistency">Naming consistency</a>. 
         The primary directory may have sub-directories.
         <li>
            For very simple libraries implemented entirely within the library header, all 
            files go in the primary directory (except headers, which go in the boost header 
            directory).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4><a name="Redirection">Redirection</a></h4>
      <p>The primary directory should always contain a file named index.html (or 
         index.htm). Authors have requested this so that they can publish URL's in the 
         form <i>http://www.boost.org/libs/lib-name</i> with the assurance a 
         documentation reorganization won't invalidate the URL. Boost's internal tools 
         are also simplified by knowing that a library's documentation is always 
         reachable via the simplified URL.</p>
      <p>If the documentation is in a doc sub-directory, the primary directory 
         index.html file should just do an automatic redirection to the doc 
         subdirectory:</p>
      <blockquote>
         <pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=doc/index.html"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Automatic redirection failed, please go to
&lt;a href="doc/index.html"&gt;doc/index.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

      <h3><a name="Naming&shy;_consistency">Naming consistency</a></h3>
      <p>As library developers and users have gained experience with Boost, the 
         following consistent naming approach has come to be viewed as very helpful, 
         particularly for larger libraries that need their own header subdirectories 
         and namespaces.</p>
      <p>Here is how it works. The library is given a name that describes the contents 
         of the library. Cryptic abbreviations are strongly discouraged. Following the 
         practice of the C++ Standard Library, names are usually singular rather than 
         plural. For example, a library dealing with file systems might chose the 
         name "filesystem", but not "filesystems", "fs" or "nicecode".</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            The library's primary directory (in parent <i>boost-root/libs</i>) is given 
            that same name.&nbsp; For example, <i>boost-root/libs/filesystem</i>.<br>
         &nbsp;
         <li>
            The library's primary header directory (in parent <i>boost-root/boost</i>) is 
            given that same name. For example, <i>boost-root/boost/filesystem</i>.<br>
         &nbsp;
         <li>
            The library's primary namespace (in parent <i>::boost</i>) is given that same 
            name, except when there's a component with that name (e.g., <i>boost::tuple</i>), in which case the namespace name is pluralized. For example, <i>::boost::filesystem</i>.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>When documenting Boost libraries, follow these conventions (see also the following section of this document):
    <ul>
      <li>The library name is set in roman type.</li>
      <li>The library name is capitalized.</li>
      <li>A period between "Boost" and the library name (e.g., Boost.Bind) is used if and only if the library name is not followed by the word "library".</li>
      <li>The word "library" is not part of the library name and is therefore lowercased.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are a few examples of how to apply these conventions:
    <ul>
      <li>Boost.Bind was written by Peter Dimov.</li>
      <li>The Boost Bind library was written by Peter Dimov.</li>
      <li>I regularly use Bind, a Boost library written by Peter Dimov.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3><a name="Documentation">Documentation</a></h3>
      <p>Even the simplest library needs some documentation; the amount should be 
         proportional to the need.&nbsp; The documentation should assume the readers 
         have a basic knowledge of C++, but are not necessarily experts.</p>
      <p>The format for documentation should be HTML, and should not require an advanced 
         browser or server-side extensions. Style sheets are acceptable. 
         ECMAScript/JavaScript is not acceptable. The documentation entry point should 
         always be a file named index.html or index.htm; see <a href="#Redirection">Redirection</a>.</p>
      <p>There is no single right way to do documentation. HTML documentation is often 
         organized quite differently from traditional printed documents. Task-oriented 
         styles differ from reference oriented styles. In the end, it comes down to the 
         question: Is the documentation sufficient for the mythical "average" C++ 
         programmer to use the library successfully?</p>
      <p>Appropriate topics for documentation often include:
         <ul>
            <li>
            General introduction to the library.
            <li>
            Description of each class.
            <li>
            Relationship between classes.
            <li>
            For each function, as applicable, description, requirements (preconditions), 
            effects, post-conditions, returns, and throws.
            <li>
            Discussion of error detection and recovery strategy.
            <li>
            How to use including description of typical uses.
            <li>
            How to compile and link.
            <li>
            How to test.
            <li>
            Version or revision history.
            <li>
               Rationale for design decisions.&nbsp; See <a href="#Rationale">Rationale rationale</a>.
            <li>
               Acknowledgements.&nbsp; See <a href="#Acknowledgements">Acknowledgments rationale.</a></li>

      <p>Rationale for some of the requirements and guidelines follows.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3><a name="Exception-specification">Exception-specification</a> rationale</h3>
      <p>Exception specifications [ISO 15.4] are sometimes coded to indicate what 
         exceptions may be thrown, or because the programmer hopes they will improved 
         performance.&nbsp; But consider the following member from a smart pointer:</p>
      <pre>    T&amp; operator*() const throw()  { return *ptr; }</pre>
      <p>This function calls no other functions; it only manipulates fundamental data 
         types like pointers Therefore, no runtime behavior of the 
         exception-specification can ever be invoked.&nbsp; The function is completely 
         exposed to the compiler; indeed it is declared inline Therefore, a smart 
         compiler can easily deduce that the functions are incapable of throwing 
         exceptions, and make the same optimizations it would have made based on the 
         empty exception-specification. A "dumb" compiler, however, may make all kinds 
         of pessimizations.</p>
      <p>For example, some compilers turn off inlining if there is an 
         exception-specification.&nbsp; Some compilers add try/catch blocks. Such 
         pessimizations can be a performance disaster which makes the code unusable in 
         practical applications.</p>
      <p>Although initially appealing, an exception-specification tends to have 
         consequences that require <b>very</b> careful thought to understand. The 
         biggest problem with exception-specifications is that programmers use them as 
         though they have the effect the programmer would like, instead of the effect 
         they actually have.</p>
      <p>A non-inline function is the one place a "throws nothing" 
         exception-specification may have some benefit with some compilers.</p>

      <h3><a name="Naming">Naming</a> conventions rationale</h3>
      <p>The C++ standard committee's Library Working Group discussed this issue in 
         detail, and over a long period of time. The discussion was repeated again in 
         early boost postings. A short summary:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
         Naming conventions are contentious, and although several are widely used, no 
         one style predominates.
         <li>
         Given the intent to propose portions of boost for the next revision of the C++ 
         standard library, boost decided to follow the standard library's conventions.
         <li>
            Once a library settles on a particular convention, a vast majority of 
            stakeholders want that style to be consistently used.
         </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Source <a name="code_fonts">code fonts</a> rationale</h3>
      <p>Dave Abrahams comments: An important purpose (I daresay the primary purpose) of 
         source code is communication: the documentation of intent. This is a doubly 
         important goal for boost, I think. Using a fixed-width font allows us to 
         communicate with more people, in more ways (diagrams are possible) right there 
         in the source. Code written for fixed-width fonts using spaces will read 
         reasonably well when viewed with a variable-width font, and as far as I can 
         tell every editor supporting variable-width fonts also supports fixed width. I 
         don't think the converse is true.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3><a name="Tabs">Tabs</a> rationale</h3>
      <p>Tabs are banned because of the practical problems caused by tabs in 
         multi-developer projects like Boost, rather than any dislike in principle. See <a href="mailing_lists.htm#archive">
            mailing list archives</a>. Problems include maintenance of a single source 
         file by programmers using tabs and programmers using spaces, and the difficulty 
         of enforcing a consistent tab policy other than just "no tabs". Discussions 
         concluded that Boost files should either all use tabs, or all use spaces, and 
         thus the decision to stick with spaces.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>ECMAScript/<a name="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> rationale</h3>
      <p>Before the 1.29.0 release, two Boost libraries added ECMAScript/JavaScript 
         documentation. Controversy followed (see <a href="mailing_lists.htm#archive">mailing 
            list archives</a>), and the developers were asked to remove the 
         ECMAScript/JavaScript. Reasons given for banning included:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
         Incompatible with some older browsers and some text based browsers.
         <li>
         Makes printing docs pages difficult.
         <li>
         Often results in really bad user interface design.
         <li>
         "It's just annoying in general."
         <li>
         Would require Boost to test web pages for ECMAScript/JavaScript compliance.
         <li>
            Makes docs maintenance by other than the original developer more difficult.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a name="Rationale_rationale">Rationale rationale</a></h3>
      <p>Rationale is defined as "The fundamental reasons for something; basis" by the 
         American Heritage Dictionary.</p>
      <p>Beman Dawes comments:&nbsp; Failure to supply contemporaneous rationale for 
         design decisions is a major defect in many software projects. Lack of accurate 
         rationale causes issues to be revisited endlessly, causes maintenance bugs when 
         a maintainer changes something without realizing it was done a certain way for 
         some purpose, and shortens the useful lifetime of software.</p>
      <p>Rationale is fairly easy to provide at the time decisions are made, but very 
         hard to accurately recover even a short time later.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3><a name="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a> rationale</h3>
      <p>As a library matures, it almost always accumulates improvements suggested to 
         the authors by other boost members.&nbsp; It is a part of the culture of 
         boost.org to acknowledge such contributions, identifying the person making the 
         suggestion.&nbsp; Major contributions are usually acknowledged in the 
         documentation, while minor fixes are often mentioned in comments within the 
         code itself.</p>
