<h1>Boost Library Submission Process</h1>
<p>This page describes the process a library developer goes through to get a 
library accepted by Boost.</p>
<p>See the <a href="lib_guide.htm">Boost Library Requirements and Guidelines</a>
page for issues of content.</p>

<h2><a name="Learn">Learn</a> about Boost</h2>
<p>Subscribe to the <a href="mailing_lists.htm#main">main developers mailing list</a> for a
while, or look through the <a href="mailing_lists.htm#archive">archives</a>.&nbsp;
Click around the <a href="../index.htm">web site</a>.&nbsp; Understand the <a href="lib_guide.htm">Requirements</a>.&nbsp;
Read the rest of this page to learn about the process.&nbsp; Otherwise, you will
just end up wasting everyone's time.</p>
<p>There is a culture associated with Boost, aimed at encouraging high quality
libraries by a process of discussion and refinement.</p>
<p>If what you really want is a site that will just post your library without
even looking at it, you should go elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Determine <a name="interest">interest</a></h2>
<p>Potential library submitters should use the Boost developers <a href="mailing_lists.htm">mailing
list</a> as a forum to gauge interest a possible submission.</p>
<p>A message might be as simple as &quot;Is there any interest in a library
which solves Traveling Salesperson problems in linear time?&quot;</p>
<p>A bit of further description or snippet of code may be helpful. Messages
should be plain text; not rich text, HTML, etc.</p>
<p>Please don't post lengthy descriptions, documentation, or code to the mailing
list, and no attachments, even small ones.&nbsp; Please post lengthy material in
the boost <a href="http://boost-sandbox.sourceforge.net/vault/">Sandbox Vault</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Preliminary">Preliminary</a> submission</h2>
<p>If response to an initial query indicates interest, then post the preliminary
submission files in the <a href="http://boost-sandbox.sourceforge.net/vault/">Sandbox Vault</a> on
the sourceforge web site if you haven't already done so.</p>
<h2><a name="Refinement">Refinement</a></h2>
<p>Discuss, refine, resubmit.&nbsp; Repeat until satisfied.</p>
<p>The exact details of this process varies a lot.&nbsp; Sometimes it is public,
on the mailing list, sometimes a lot of discussion happens in private
emails.&nbsp; For some libraries the process is over quickly, for others it goes
on for months.&nbsp; It's often challenging, and sometimes leads off in
completely unexpected directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="mailing_lists.htm#archive">archive</a> of past
messages is one way to see how this process worked for other Boost
libraries.</p>
<h2><a name="Submission">Submission</a> for review&nbsp;</h2>
<p>All of the files which make up the library should be combined and compressed
into a single submission file using the .zip format.&nbsp; Free encoders
and decoders for this format running on many different platforms are available
at the <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/">Info-ZIP</a> web site, which
includes a FAQ and much other useful information about the .zip format. Many
commercial compressor-archiver utilities also support this format.</p>
<p>The submission file should contain material as if on the
boost.org web site.&nbsp; The closer the submission file mirrors the final
<a href="lib_guide.htm#Directory_structure">directory
structure</a> and format of the web site, the better.
<p>Like a preliminary submission, post the final submission .zip file in the <a href="http://boost-sandbox.sourceforge.net/vault/">Sandbox Vault</a> of
the sourceforge site.
<h2>Formal <a name="Review">Review</a></h2>
<p>Before asking for formal review, your submission should be posted in the
Boost files/vault. Please verify that your submission compiles
and runs under at least two compilers.&nbsp; This flushes out obvious
portability problems.&nbsp; If you don't have access to a second compiler, ask
for help on the Boost mailing list.</p>
<p>Once a library author feels a submission (which presumably is now in the
files/vault) has matured enough for formal review, the author sends a message
requesting a formal review to the mailing list.&nbsp; Please use a subject in
the form &quot;Review Request: library&quot; where <i>library</i> is replaced by
the library name.</p>
<p>See <a href="formal_review_process.htm">Formal Review Process</a> for
details.</p>
<p>Formal Review schedules are posted on
  the <a href="formal_review_schedule.html">web site</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Boost web <a name="site posting">site posting</a></h2>
<p>Once an accepted library is ready for inclusion on the Boost web site, the 
submitter is typically given Boost CVS write access, and expected to check-in 
and maintain the library in the CVS. Contact the moderators if you need write 
access or CVS use isn't possible for you.</p>
<h2><a name="People">People</a> page</h2>
<p>If the boost.org web site doesn't already have your capsule biography
and&nbsp; picture (optional, with not-too-serious pictures preferred), please
send them to the Boost webmaster. It is
up to you as to whether or not the biography includes your email address or
other contact information.&nbsp; The preferred picture format is .jpg, but other
common formats are acceptable.&nbsp; The preferred image size is 500x375 but the
webmaster has photo editing software and can do the image preparation if
necessary.</p>
<h2><a name="Lifecycle">Lifecycle</a></h2>
<p>Libraries are software; they lose their value over time if not maintained. 
Postings on the Boost developers or users mailing lists can alert you to 
potential maintenance needs; please plan to maintain your library over time. If 
you no longer can or wish to maintain your library, please post a message on the 
Boost developers mailing list and help someone else take over as the library 
maintainer.</p>
