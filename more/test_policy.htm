<h1>Boost Test Policies and Protocols</h1>
<p>The Boost libraries are intended to be both reliable and portable.&nbsp;
Every experienced programmer knows that means each library must be tested against a suitable number of test cases, on a wide range of platforms,
and then tested again (regression tested) every time a change is made and before
every release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Quality assurance based on a wide range of targeted tests&quot; as one
of the key answers to C.A.R
Hoare's question
&quot;How did software get so reliable without proof.&quot;</p>
<h2>Regression test</h2>
<p>Boost uses an automatic <a href="regression.html"> regression test suite</a> which generates HTML
<a href="../status/compiler_status.html">compiler
status tables</a>.</p>
<h2>Test Policy</h2>
<h3>Required</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Every Boost library should supply one or more suitable test programs to be
    exercised by the Boost <a href="regression.html"> regression test suite</a>.&nbsp; In addition to
    the usual compile-link-run tests expecting successful completion,
    compile-only or compile-and-link-only tests may be performed, and success
    for the test may be defined as failure of the steps.</li>
  <li>Test program execution must report errors by returning a non-zero value.&nbsp; They
    may also write to stdout or stderr, but that output should be relatively
    brief.&nbsp; Regardless of other output, a non-zero return value is the only
    way the regression test framework will recognize an error has
    occurred.&nbsp;Note that test programs to be included in the status tables must
    compile, link, and run quickly since the tests are executed many, many,
    times.</li>
  <li>Libraries with time consuming tests should be divided into a
    fast-execution basic test program for the status tables, and a separate
    full-coverage test program for exhaustive test cases.&nbsp; The basic test
    should concentrate on compilation issues so that the status tables
    accurately reflect the library's likelihood of correct compilation on a
    platform.</li>
  <li>If for any reason the usual test policies do not apply to a particular 
  library, an alternate test strategy must be implemented.</li>
  <li>A <a href="regression.html#Adding_new_test">Jamfile</a> to drive the 
  regression tests for the library. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optional (but highly recommended)</h3>
<p>The <a href="../libs/test/index.html">Boost Test Library</a> provides many 
useful components which ease the construction of test programs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the library's
  <a href="../libs/test/doc/components/test_tools/index.html">Test Tools</a> for the construction of simple test 
  programs that do not need much structure.</li>
  <li>Use the library's
  <a href="../libs/test/doc/components/utf/index.html">Unit Test 
  Framework</a> for the construction of more complex test programs that need to 
  be structured into individual tests
    and test suites.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Suggested Protocol for Fixing Bugs or Adding Features.</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First, add regression test cases that detects the bug or tests the
    feature. Sometimes adding one case suggests similar untested cases, and they
    are added too.</li>
  <li>Second, for bugs, run the regression test and verify that the bug is now
    detected.</li>
  <li>Third, then, and only then, fix the bug or add the feature.</li>
  <li>Finally, rerun the full regression tests - sometimes the change breaks
    something else.</li>
</ul>
