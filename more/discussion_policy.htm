<h1>Boost Discussion Policy</h1>
<p>Email discussion is the tie that binds boost members together into a community.
If the discussion is stimulating and effective, the community thrives. If
the discussion degenerates into name calling and ill will, the community withers
and dies.</p>

<h2><a name="acceptable"></a>Acceptable topics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Queries to determine interest in a possible library submission.</li>
  <li>Technical discussions about a proposed or existing library, including bug
    reports and requests for help.</li>
  <li>Formal Reviews of proposed libraries.</li>
  <li>Reports of user experiences with Boost libraries.</li>
  <li>Boost administration or policies.</li>
  <li>Compiler specific workarounds as applied to Boost libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other topics related to boost development may be acceptable, at the discretion of moderators. If unsure, go ahead and post. The moderators
will let you know.</p>
<h2><a name="unacceptable"></a>Unacceptable Topics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Advertisements for commercial products.</li>
  <li>Requests for help getting non-boost code to compile with your compiler.
    Try the comp.lang.c++.moderated newsgroup instead.</li>
  <li>Requests for help interpreting the C++ standard. Try the comp.std.c++
    newsgroup instead.</li>
  <li>Job offers.</li>
  <li>Requests for solutions to homework assignments.</ul>
<h2><a name="effective"></a>Effective Posting</h2>

<p>When your post is related to a particular Boost library, it's
helpful to put the library name in square brackets at the beginning of
the subject line, e.g.

<blockquote>
  Subject: [Regex] Why doesn't this pattern match?
</blockquote>

The Boost developers' list is a high-volume mailing list, and most
maintainers don't have time to read every message.  A tag on the
subject line will help ensure the right people see your post.

<p><a name="quoting"></a>
Please <b>prune extraneous quoted text</b> from replies so that
only the relevant parts are included. Some people have to pay for, or
wait for, each byte that they download from the list.  More
importantly, it will save time and make your post more valuable when
readers do not have to find out which exact part of a previous message
you are responding to.

<p>A common and very useful approach is to cite the small fractions of
the message you are actually responding to and to put your response
directly beneath each citation, with a blank line separating them for
readability:

<blockquote>
<pre>

&gt; Some part of a paragraph that you wish to reply to goes 
&gt; here; there may be several lines.

Your response to that part of the message goes here.  There may,
of course, be several lines.

&gt; The second part of the  paragraph that is relevant to your 
&gt; reply goes here; agiain there may be several lines.

Your response to the second part of the message goes here.
...

</pre>
</blockquote>

For more information about effective use of quotation in posts, see <a
href="http://www.netmeister.org/news/learn2quote.html">this helpful
guide</a>.

<p>A summary of the foregoing thread is only needed after a long
discussion, especially when the topic is drifting or a result has been
achieved in a discussion.  The mail system will do the tracking that
is needed to enable mail readers to display message threads (and every
decent mail reader supports that).

<p>If you ever have to refer to single message earlier in a thread or
in a different thread then you can use a URL to the <a
href="mailing_lists.htm#archive">message archives</a>.  To help to
keep those URLs short, you can use <a
href="http://www.tinyurl.com">tinyurl.com</a>. Citing the relevant
portion of a message you link to is often helpful (if the citation is
small).

<p>Don't forget, you're a single writer but there are many readers,
and you want them to stay interested in what you're saying.  Saving
your readers a little time and effort is usually worth the extra time
you spend when writing a message.  Also, boost discussions are saved
for posterity, as rationales and history of the work we do.  A post's
usefulness in the future is determined by its readability.

<p>The mailing list software automatically limits message and
attachment size to a reasonable amount, typically 75K, which is
adjusted from time-to-time by the moderators.. This limit is a
courtesy to those who rely on dial-up Internet access.
</p>

<p><b>When starting a new topic, always send a fresh message</b>,
rather than beginning a reply to some other message and replacing the
subject and body.  Many mailers are able to detect the thread you
started with and will show the new message as part of the original
thread, which probably isn't what you intended. Follow this guideline
for your own sake as well as for others'.  Often, people scanning for
relevant messages will decide they're done with a topic and hide or
kill the entire thread: your message will be missed, and you won't get
the response you're looking for.

<p><b>Do not reply to digests</b> if you are a digest delivery
subscriber.  Your reply will not be properly threaded and will
probably have the wrong subject line.  Instead, you can reply through
the <a href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.devel">GMane
web interface</a>.

<h2><a name="behavior"></a>Prohibited Behavior</h2>
<p>Prohibited behavior will not be tolerated. The moderators will ban
postings by abusers.</p>
<h3>Flame wars</h3>
<p>Personal insults, argument for the sake of argument, and all the other
behaviors which fall into the &quot;flame war&quot; category are
prohibited. Discussions should focus on technical arguments, not the
personality traits or motives of participants.</p>
<h3>Third-party attacks</h3>
<p>Attacks on third parties such as software vendors, hardware vendors, or any
other organizations, are prohibited. Boost exists to unite and serve the
entire C++ community, not to disparage the work of others.</p>
<p>Does this mean that we ban the occasional complaint or wry remark about a
troublesome compiler? No, but be wary of overdoing it.</p>
<h3>Off-topic posts</h3>
<p>Discussions which stray from the acceptable topics are strongly discouraged.
While off-topic posts are often well meaning and not as individually corrosive
as other abuses, cumulatively the distraction damages the effectiveness of
discussion.</p>
<h2><a name="culture"></a>Culture</h2>
<p>In addition to technical skills, Boost members value collaboration,
acknowledgement of the help of others, and a certain level of politeness. Boost
membership is very international, and ranges widely in age and other
characteristics. Think of discussion as occurring among colleagues in a widely read forum, rather
than among a few close friends.</p>

<p>Always remember that the cumulative effort spent by people reading
your contribution scales with the (already large) number of boost
members.  Thus, do invest time and effort to make your message as
readable as possible.  Adhere to English syntax and grammar rules such
as proper capitalization.  Avoid copious informalism, colloquial
language, or abbreviations, they may not be understood by all readers.
Re-read your message before submitting it.</p>

<h2>Guidelines for Effective Discussions</h2>
<p>Apply social engineering to prevent heated technical discussion from
degenerating into a shouting match, and to actively encourage the cooperation 
upon which Boost depends.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Questions help. If someone suggests something that you don't think
    will work, then replying with a question like &quot;will that compile?&quot;
    or &quot;won't that fail to compile, or am I missing something?&quot; is a
    lot smoother than &quot;That's really stupid - it won't compile.&quot;&nbsp;
    Saying &quot;that fails to compile for me, and seems to violate section
    n.n.n of the standard&quot; would be yet another way to be firm without
    being abrasive.</li>
  <li>If most of the discussion has been code-free generalities, posting a bit
    of sample code can focus people on the practical issues.</li>
  <li>If most of the discussion has been in terms of specific code, try to talk
    a bit about hidden assumptions and generalities that may be preventing
    discussion closure.</li>
  <li>Taking a time-out is often effective. Just say: &quot;Let me think
    about that for a day or two. Let's take a time-out to digest the
    discussion so far.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid Parkinson's Bicycle Shed. Parkinson described a committee formed
to oversee design of an early nuclear power plant. There were three agenda
items - when to have tea, where to put the bicycle shed, and how to
ensure nuclear safety. Tea was disposed of quickly as trivial.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nuclear safety was discussed for only
an hour - it was so complex, scary, and technical that even
among experts few felt comfortable with the issues. Endless days were then
spent discussing where to put the bicycle shed (the parking lot would
be a modern equivalent) because everyone
understood the issues and felt comfortable discussing them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="lib_names"></a>Library Names</h2>

<p>In order to ensure a uniform presentation in books and articles, we
have adopted a convention for referring to Boost libraries.  Library
names can either be written in a compact form with a dot, as
&quot;Boost.<i>Name</i>&quot;, or in a long form as &quot;the
Boost <i>Name</i> library.&quot;  For example:
<blockquote>
<b>Boost.Python</b> serves a very different purpose from <b>the Boost Graph library</b>.
</blockquote>
Note that the word &quot;library&quot; is not part of the name, and as such isn't capitalized.

<p>Please take care to avoid confusion in discussions between
libraries that have been accepted into Boost and those that have not.
Acceptance as a Boost library indicates that the code and design have
passed through our peer-review process; failing to make the
distinction devalues the hard work of library authors who've gone
through that process.  Here are some suggested ways to describe
potential Boost libraries:
<ul>
  <li>the proposed Boost <i>Name</i> library</li>
  <li>the Boost.<i>Name</i> candidate</li>
  <li>the <i>Name</i> library</i> (probably the best choice where applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this policy only applies to discussions, not to the
documentation, directory structure, or even identifiers in the
code of potential Boost libraries.
