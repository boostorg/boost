  degree in Mineralogy (<a href=
  "http://www.mineralogie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/eng/index.html">Bochum,
  Germany</a>), and a Ph.D. in Crystallography (<a href=
  "http://www.crystal.mat.ethz.ch/Intro/lfkcry">ETH Zurich</a> ,
  Switzerland). Real Mineralogists and Crystallographers run experiments with
  x-rays and hardware that is not normally associated with C++ and Boost.
  However, when Ralf kept breaking the expensive experimental equipment too
  often, he decided that he would cause less damage as a computational
  crystallographer.</p>

  <p>Being a scientist, Ralf spent most of his life programming in Fortran,
  the great grand-father of all good programming languages (if you know
  Backus-Naur you know the name of the <a href=
  "http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Backus.html">inventor
  of Fortran</a>). Ralf is a co-author of the <a href=
  "http://cns.csb.yale.edu/">CNS</a> Fortran program that is very popular in
  structural biology. When he learned that a real programmer can write
  Fortran in any language, Ralf knew that it was time for him to learn C++.
  Of course, absorbing four decades of progress in the field of computer
  science all at once crashed his brain. To be able to deal with the
  challenge, he spawned two child processes and named them Lisa and Anna. To
  see Lisa, click on the picture and turn your monitor by 180 degrees around
  the view axis. (Other pictures of <a href=
  "http://cci.lbl.gov/~rwgk/Lisa-Roza-Illes/">Lisa</a> and <a href=
  "http://cci.lbl.gov/~rwgk/Anna-Rhona-Illes/">Anna</a> do not require
  gymnastics with the monitor.)</p>

  <p>Right now, Ralf is working for the <a href=
  "http://cci.lbl.gov/">Computational Crystallography Initiative</a> at the
  <a href="http://www.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> in
  California. The goal of this initiative is to write a software system for
  high-throughput protein crystal structure determination, also known as
  <a href="http://www.nigms.nih.gov/news/announcements/psi.html">Structural
  Genomics</a>. Surprisingly, the gestation period for such a system turns
  out to be much longer than it was for Lisa and Anna. However, pre-natal
  diagnosis already revealed that Python and C++ are the parents-to-be. For
  an ultra-sound image of the new system at its early developmental stage
