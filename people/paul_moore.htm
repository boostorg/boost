      Moore lives in Cheshire, England. He is married, with one son. His &quot;day 
      job&quot; is as an Oracle DBA, but he writes C and C++ programs in his spare 
      time.</p>
    <p>Paul started programming on Acorn's BBC Micro and RISC PC series of computers, 
      but finally went mainstream and bought a PC, on which he now runs Windows and 
      Linux. Paul's main interest is in porting and developing open-source software, 
      and so his main programming language is C (at least until the open source 
      community switches to C++).</p>
    <p>Paul's main claim to C++ fame is that he owns all 3 editions of Bjarne 
      Stroustrup's &quot;The C++ Programming language&quot;, plus the ARM and the C++ 
      standard, but he didn't own a C++ compiler until after the 3rd edition of 
      Stroustrup's book came out. Make of that what you will...</p>
