    Joel got into electronics and programming in the 80s because almost 
    everything in music, his first love, is becoming electronic and digital. 
    Back then, he used to build his own guitars, effect boxes and synths. He 
    enjoys playing distortion-laden rock guitar, composes and produces his own 
    music in his home studio.</p>
    <p>In the 90s, he went to Japan and worked there as a software engineer. 
    There, he learned C++ and immediately fell in love it. He's still trying his 
    best to master the language in all its immensity.</p>
    
<p>Joel is quite adept in writing code using modern C++ techniques such as template 
  metaprogramming and C++ functional programming. He's very happy and enthusiastic 
  with his current job as a consultant and engineer at <a href="http://www.boost-consulting.com">Boost 
  Consulting</a>.</p>
