== Version 4.6.0

This release wraps up a few new features that make using some toolsets easier
(thanks to Nikita). It's now also possible to specify empty flags features on
the command line, like `cxxfalgs=`, and have those be ignored. This helps to
make CI scripts shorter as they don't need to handle those cases specially.
And as usual there are many bug fixes and adjustments. Thanks to everyone who
contributed to this release.

* *New:* Allow clang toolset to be auto-configured to a specific version by using
  `toolset=clang-xx` on the command line.
  -- _Nikita Kniazev_
* *New:* Include pch header automatically and on-demand on gcc and msvc toolset to
  mirror clang functionality.
  -- _Nikita Kniazev_
* *New:* Features that are narked as 'free' and 'optional' will now be ignored when
  the value specified on the command line is empty. Hence once can specify
  `cxxflags=` on the command line without errors.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* Preserve `bootstrap.sh` invoke arguments to forward to the `build.sh` script.
  -- _tkoecker_
* Remove use of `local` in `buils.sh` to be compatible with some, not fully
  capable, shells.

  specific properties.

  when using the custom `cxx` toolset to build the engine.
  -- _Samuel Debionne_ and _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* Fix detection of `intel-linux` toolset installation when only the compiler
  executable is in the `PATH`.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* Fix `b2` executable path determination for platforms that don't have a
  native method of getting the path to executables, like OpenBSD.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* Fix `property.find` error message.
  -- _Thomas Brown_

* Change references in documentation and sources of boost.org to point
  at equivalent bfgroup resources.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_

Minor patch to correct missing fix for macOS default engine compiler.

* Fix engine build defaulting to gcc instead of clang on macOS/Xcode.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_

== Version 4.4.0

Along with a variety of fixes this version introduces "dynamic" response file
support for some toolsets. This means that under most circumstances, if
supported by the toolset, response files are not generated. Instead the
command is expanded to include the options directly.

* *New:* Add `response-file` feature to control the kind of response file usage in
  toolset action.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* *New:* Add `:O=value` variable modifier for `@()` expansion.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_

  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* *New:* Add support for Intel oneAPI release to intel-windows toolset.
  -- _Edward Diener_

  tweak as hardware and software was not up to doing multiple links at once.
  Common setups are better equipped.

== Version 4.3.0

There are many invidual fixes in this release. Many thanks for the
contributions. Special thanks to Nikita for the many improvements to msvc
and general plugging of support holes in all the compilers.

There are some notable new features from Dmitry, Edward, and Nkita:

* *New:* Add `force-include` feature to include headers before all sources.
  -- _Nikita Kniazev_
* *New:* Partial support for Embarcadero C++ compilers based on clang-5.
  -- _Edward Diener_
* *New:* Implement configurable installation prefixes that use features.
  -- _Dmitry Arkhipov_
* *New:* Add `translate-path` feature. The translate-path feature allows for
  custom path handling, with a provided rule, on a per target basis. This can
  be used to support custom path syntax.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* *New:* Add portable B2 system install option. This allows the b2 executable
  and the build system files to live side by side. And hence to be (re)located
  anywhere on disk. Soon to be used to supports Windows and other installers.

particular the bootstrap/build process now clearly communicates C++11
requirement.

* Add `saxonhe_dir` action.
  -- _Richard Hodges_

Many small bug fixes in this release. But there are some new features also.
There's now an `lto` feature to specify the use of LTO, and what kind. The
existing `stdlib` feature now has real values and corresponding options
for some toolsets. But most importantly there's new documentation for all
the features.

== Version 4.0.1

This patch release fixes a minor issue when trying to configure toolsets that
override the toolset version with a non-version tag. Currently this is only
known to be a problem if you: (a) configure a toolset version to something
like "`tot`" (b) in Boost 1.72.0 when it creates cmake install artifacts.
Fix for this was provided Peter Dimov.

== Version 4.0.0

After even more years of development the landscape of build systems has changed
considerably, and so has the landscape of compilers. This version marks the
start of B2 transitioning to a {CPP} implementation. Initially this means that
the engine will be compiled as C++ source but that source is still the base
C implementation. Over time it will transform to a {CPP} code base in both the
engine and build system. Some changes in this start:

* Requires {CPP} 11 to build engine.
* Simplified build scripts to make it easier to maintain.
* Building with {CPP} optimizations gives an immediate performance improvement.

Other changes in this release:

* Add support for using prebuilt OpenSSL. -- _Damian Jarek_
* Define the riscv architecture feature. -- _Andreas Schwab_
* Add ARM64 as a valid architecture for MSVC. -- _Marc Sweetgall_
* Set coverage flags, from coverage feature, for gcc and clang. -- _Damian Jarek_
* Add s390x CPU and support in gcc/clang. -- _Neale Ferguson_
* Support importing pkg-config packages. -- _Dmitry Arkhipov_
* Support for leak sanitizer. -- _Damian Jarek_
* Fix missing `/manifest` option in clang-win to fix admin elevation for exes
  with "update" in the name. -- _Peter Dimov_
* Add `freertos` to `os` feature. -- _Thomas Brown_
* Default parallel jobs (`-jX`) to the available CPU threads. -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* Simpler coverage feature. -- _Hans Dembinski_
* Better stacks for sanitizers. -- _James E. King III_

WARNING: The default number of parallel jobs has changed in this release from
"1" to the number of cores. There are circumstances when that default can be
larger than the allocated cpu resources, for instance in some virtualized
container installs.
